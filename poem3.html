           <b> A Line-storm Song</b> <br>
Add this poem to an anthology <br>
Robert Frost <br>
1874 
1963 <br>
The line-storm clouds fly tattered and swift, <br>
  The road is forlorn all day, <br>
Where a myriad snowy quartz stones lift, <br>
  And the hoof-prints vanish away. <br>
The roadside flowers, too wet for the bee, <br>
  Expend their bloom in vain. <br>
Come over the hills and far with me, <br>
  And be my love in the rain. <br>

The birds have less to say for themselves <br>
  In the wood-world’s torn despair <br>
Than now these numberless years the elves, <br>
  Although they are no less there: <br>
All song of the woods is crushed like some <br>
  Wild, easily shattered rose. <br>
Come, be my love in the wet woods; come, <br>
  Where the boughs rain when it blows. <br>

There is the gale to urge behind <br>
  And bruit our singing down, <br>
And the shallow waters aflutter with wind <br>
  From which to gather your gown.    <br>
What matter if we go clear to the west, <br>
  And come not through dry-shod? <br>
For wilding brooch shall wet your breast <br>
  The rain-fresh goldenrod. <br>

Oh, never this whelming east wind swells <br>  
  But it seems like the sea’s return <br>
To the ancient lands where it left the shells <br>
  Before the age of the fern; <br>
And it seems like the time when after doubt <br>
  Our love came back amain.      <br>
Oh, come forth into the storm and rout <br>
  And be my love in the rain. <br>
