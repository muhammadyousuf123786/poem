           <b> Morning in the Burned House </b> <br><br>
Add this poem to an anthology <br>
Margaret Atwood
1939 <br>
In the burned house I am eating breakfast. <br>
You understand: there is no house, there is no breakfast, <br>
yet here I am. <br>

The spoon which was melted scrapes against <br>
the bowl which was melted also. <br>
No one else is around. <br>

Where have they gone to, brother and sister, <br>
mother and father? Off along the shore, <br>
perhaps. Their clothes are still on the hangers, <br>

their dishes piled beside the sink, <br>
which is beside the woodstove <br>
with its grate and sooty kettle, <br>

every detail clear, <br>
tin cup and rippled mirror. <br>
The day is bright and songless, <br>

the lake is blue, the forest watchful. <br>
In the east a bank of cloud <br>
rises up silently like dark bread. <br>

I can see the swirls in the oilcloth, <br>
I can see the flaws in the glass, <br>
those flares where the sun hits them. <br>

I can't see my own arms and legs <br>
or know if this is a trap or blessing, <br>
finding myself back here, where everything <br>

in this house has long been over, <br>
kettle and mirror, spoon and bowl, <br>
including my own body, <br>

including the body I had then, <br>
including the body I have now <br>
as I sit at this morning table, alone and happy, <br>

bare child's feet on the scorched floorboards <br>
(I can almost see) <br>
in my burning clothes, the thin green shorts <br>

and grubby yellow T-shirt <br>
holding my cindery, non-existent, <br>
radiant flesh. Incandescent. <br>
        </p>
    </div>
